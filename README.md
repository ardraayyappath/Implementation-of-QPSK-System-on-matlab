# Implementation-of-QPSK-System-on-matlab

A QPSK system with symbol duration Ts = 2 ns and carrier frequency fc = 1 GHz was implemented, to analyse bit error rate for different transfer functions. The transmitter uses the in-phase, I, and the quadrature, Q, components to generate the corresponding symbols, where I = 1, −1 and Q = 1, −1. For the transmitter pulse,square pulses with amplitude 1 and duration Ts were considered. Gray encoding is used to define the bits carried by each symbol.
